* to deploy locally

1. type ' ng build ' in angular app then it will load files in dist or in nodejs folder (    if specified in angular.json file in angular project), Note: both ng build and ng serve clear the output folder before they build the project but only the ng build command writes the generated build artifacts to the output folder(dist).

2. Note: base url(in service class) in angular is http://localhost:3000/tasks ( used to get services from back end nodejs ) this works here because nodejs server is started at localhost:3000. but will not when deployed in remote server.

3.Note: cors is no longer required as frontend is run on backend server. before we required cors because angular is run on http://localhost:4200 and nodejs is run on http://localhost:3000 so we required cors to access different domains.

4. get var path = require('path');//for loading static page path.join in index.js in nodejs(gets the root path)

5. the ng build file (dist) should be in nodejs folder

6.  app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname,'dist/todolist'))); is used to tell server to load static files from this.

7. in order to load index page we use app.get http service to load from dist by setting path

app.get('/',(req,res)=>{
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname,'dist/todolist/index.html'))
});
